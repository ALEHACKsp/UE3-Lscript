# UE3-Lscript
Unreal Engine 3 LScript for UT3

im releasing source of my UE3 lscript hack for UT3 game based on old LScript workspace made for AAO game.

No need anymore SDK dump for UE3 game using this hacking method so you don't need to update your sdk every game release

It can be easily ported to any UE3 games just changing main structs and replace offset

Note:
Function can be improve and/or added to source and called via lscript

Bug:
FindFirst/FindNext functions are not working so feel free to fix it
